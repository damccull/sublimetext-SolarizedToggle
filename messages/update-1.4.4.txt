Version 1.4.4

Changes:
* Reintroducing basic theme switching support. Thanks to InfernoZeus@github.

NOTE: This plugin will overwrite the following settings in your USER Preferences.sublime-settings file:
	* color_scheme
	* theme (if themes are enabled)

NOTE: There is an issue with the theme switcher for both versions of Sublime Text where the window sometimes does not update the entire theme, leaving some artifacts of the previous theme behind. I currently believe this to be a limitation of Sublime Text itself. To fix the issue, simple resize or minimize/restore your window. This will cause the window to redraw itself with the new theme.
