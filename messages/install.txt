Thanks for installing Solarized Toggle.

This simple plugin allows you to easily and quickly toggle between the two color schemes at the simple press of a key. The default schemes are Solarized light and dark.

By default the key is mapped to F12 (CMD+F12 on OSX), so by pressing F12, you should now see your color scheme change to Solarized Light or Dark, depending on what was already displayed.

NOTE: This plugin will overwrite the following settings in your USER Preferences.sublime-settings file:
	* color_scheme
	* theme (if themes are enabled)

NOTE: There is an issue with the theme switcher for both versions of Sublime Text where the window sometimes does not update the entire theme, leaving some artifacts of the previous theme behind. I currently believe this to be a limitation of Sublime Text itself. To fix the issue, simple resize or minimize/restore your window. This will cause the window to redraw itself with the new theme.

NOTE: This plugin DOES NOT require the Solarized Color Scheme plugin from the Package Control repositories. It defaults the the color schemes built into Sublime Text 2 and 3.
